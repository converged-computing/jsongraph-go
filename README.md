# JSON Graph Format (JGF) (Go structs)

**under development**

More coming soon!

This is a simple library that provides go structures for [JSON Graph schema](https://github.com/jsongraph/json-graph-specification) for use in other projects. The submodule directory with the schema is only
required for testing.

## Usage

Build the examples:

```bash
make
```

Run an example:

```
./examples/bin/cars
```

(examples are not added yet, coming soon)
